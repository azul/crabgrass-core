-# this template is used when you want to show an alert message but you don't
-# render anything about the page that triggered this error, typically for security reasons.
-#
-# this template lists all the alert messages inline, instead of floating.
-#
-# this page is triggered like so:
-#
-#   error 'oh now, something bad happened'
-#   render template: 'error/alert', layout: 'notice'
-#
-# It is not just for errors, can be success alerts too.
